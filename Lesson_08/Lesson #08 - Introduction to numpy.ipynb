We learned that NumPy makes it quick and easy to make selections of our data, and includes a number of functions and methods that make it easy to calculate statistics across the different axes (or dimensions).\n","\n","Using the skills we've learned so far, we were able to select subsets of our taxi trip data and then calculate things like the maximum, minimum, sum, and mean of various columns and rows. But what if we wanted to find out how many trips were taken in each month? Or which airport is the busiest? For this we will need a new technique: **Boolean Indexing.**\n","\n","In the previous section, we used Python's built-in [csv module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) to import our CSV as a 'list of lists' and used loops to convert each value to a float before we created our NumPy ndarray. Now that we understand NumPy a little better, let's learn about the [numpy.genfromtxt() function](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.2/reference/generated/numpy.genfromtxt.html#numpy.genfromtxt) to read in files.\n","\n","The **numpy.genfromtxt()** function reads a text file into a NumPy ndarray. While it has over 20 parameters, for most cases you need only two. Here is the simplified syntax for the function, and an explanation of the two parameters:\n","\n","```python\n","np.genfromtxt(filename,delimiter)\n","```\n","\n","- **filename** - A positional argument, usually a string representing the path to the text file to be read.\n","- **delimiter** - A named argument, specifying the string used to separate each value.\n","In this case, because we have a CSV file, the delimiter is a comma. Let's look at what the code would look like to read in the **nyc_taxis.csv** file.\n","\n","```python\n","taxi = np.genfromtxt('nyc_taxis.csv', delimiter=',')\n","print(taxi)\n","```\n","\n","The output of this code is shown below:\n","\n","```python\n","[[   nan    nan    nan ...,    nan    nan    nan]\n"," [  2016      1      1 ...,  11.65  69.99      1]\n"," [  2016      1      1 ...,      8   54.3      1]\n"," ..., \n"," [  2016      6     30 ...,      5  63.34      1]\n"," [  2016      6     30 ...,   8.95  44.75      1]\n"," [  2016      6     30 ...,      0  54.84      2]]\n","```\n","\n","When **numpy.genfromtxt()** reads in a file, it attempts to determine the data type of the file by looking at the values. We can use the **ndarray.dtype** attribute to see the internal datatype that has been used.\n","\n","```python\n",">>> taxi.dtype\n","\n","    float64\n","```\n","\n","NumPy has chosen the **float64** type as it will allow most of the values from our CSV to be read. You can think of NumPy's **float64** type as being identical to Python's float type (the **'64'** refers to the number of bits used to store the underlying value).\n","\n","The first row of our data contains a value that we haven't seen before: **nan**. **NaN** is an acronym for **Not a Number**. The concept of NaN is an unusual one at first - it literally means that the value cannot be stored as a number. It is similar to (and often refered to interchangably as a) null value, like Python's [None constant](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/constants.html#None).\n","\n","NaN is most commonly seen when a value is missing, but in this case we have NaN because the first line from our CSV file contains the names of each column. As we mentioned in the previous mission, NumPy ndarrays can contain only one type. NumPy is unable to convert string values like **pickup_year** into the **float64** data type. Later in this course we'll talk about NaN some more in the context of missing values. For now, we need to remove this row from our ndarray. We can do this the same way we would if our data was stored in a list of lists:\n","\n","```python\n","taxi = taxi[1:]\n","```\n","\n","Which removes the first row from the array. Alternatively, we can pass an additional parameter, **skip_header**, to the **numpy.genfromtext()** function. The **skip_header** parameters accepts an integer, the number of rows from the start of the file to skip (note that because this is the number of rows and not the index, to skip the first row would require a value of **1** and not **0**).\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","1.

A boolean array, as the name suggests is an array full of boolean values. Boolean arrays are sometimes called boolean vectors or boolean masks.\n","\n","Let's take a moment to refresh our understanding of what a boolean value is. The boolean (or **bool**) type is a built-in Python type that can contain one of two unique values:\n","\n","- True\n","- False\n","\n","\n","Boolean values can be defined either by **'hard-coding'** them to the code using the keywords **True** or **False**, or alternatively by using any of the Python comparison operators like **== (equal) > (greater than), < (less than), != (not equal)**. They're commonly seen within if statements, like the example below:\n","\n","<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1cltwKCELwoqrOzBNU7AIDsJ083ykMhPL\">\n","\n","As the code is executed the boolean operation is evaluated, causing the print function to run. We can use the console to perform simple boolean operations as well:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> type(3.5) == float\n","    True\n",">>> 3 < 10\n","    True\n",">>> \"hello\" == \"goodbye\"\n","    False\n",">>> 5 > 6\n","    False\n",">>> (3 + 3) != 5\n","    True\n","```\n","\n","When we explored vector math in the first section, we learned that an operation between a ndarray and a scalar (individual) value results in a new ndarray:\n","\n","\n","```python\n",">>> np.array([2,4,6,8]) + 10\n","\n","    array([12, 14, 16, 18])\n","```\n","\n","The **+ 10** operation is applied to each value in the array.\n","\n","Now, let's look at what happens when we perform a boolean operation between an ndarray and a scalar:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> np.array([2,4,6,8]) < 5\n","\n","    array([ True,  True, False, False], dtype=bool)\n","```\n","\n","A similar pattern occurs– the 'less than five' operation is applied to each value in the array.
