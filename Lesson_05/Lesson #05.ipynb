For those unfamiliar with Ed Sheeran, Ed Sheeran is an english singer, songwriter and producer. [Ed Sheeran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran) has produced grammy award winning singles [Thinking Out Loud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-EO5I60KA), [Shape of You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGwWNGJdvx8) and many more.\n","\n","In this section, we'll be creating a mad libs of Ed Sheeran's song [The A Team](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAWcs5H-qgQ). [Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) is a game where we take a story and remove certain words:\n","\n","```\n","My mind was [VERB]-ing. After spending a day learning about [TOPIC], I couldn't [VERB] for another minute.\n","\n","I stepped outside my [NOUN], only to see a(n) [NOUN] outside my window. As the [NOUN] struck the [NOUN],\n","\n","a [NOUN] filled my [NOUN]. I ran out of the [NOUN] and [VERB]-ed. A newfound sense of [NOUN] arose.\n","```\n","\n","After removing the words, we replace these words with our own words. Often times, the ensuing story is comical and non-sensical:\n","\n","```\n","My mind was [swimming]-ing. After spending a day learning about [dirt], I couldn't [eat] for another minute.\n","\n","I stepped outside my [house], only to see a(n) [polar bear] outside my window. As the [polar bar] struck the [horse],\n","\n","a [snowman] filled my [house]. I ran out of the [house] and [screamed]-ed. A newfound sense of [peace] arose.\n","```\n","\n","In this section, we'll taking Ed Sheeran's lyrics and transforming his lyrics into a mad libs game. We'll write a program that:\n","\n","- Detects the nouns, verbs and adjectives in his lyrics.\n","\n","- Replaces these nouns, verbs and adjectives with placeholders.\n","\n","- Then, we'll replace these placeholders with our own words.\n","\n","If you'd like to see the lyrics to this song, click [here](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/edsheeran/theateam.html). Here's a sample of the first few lines of the song:\n","\n","```\n","White lips, pale face\n","\n","Breathing in snowflakes\n","\n","Burnt lungs, sour taste\n","\n","........\n","```\n","\n","Through the process of creating this mad libs program, you'll learn how to:\n","\n","- Plan out your program using pseudo-code\n","\n","- Split a string into multiple strings\n","\n","- Change string letters to upper and lower case\n","\n","- Concatenate two strings into one\n","\n","- Replace specific portions of a string\n","\n","- Format a string based on our input.\n","\n","Let's get started!\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","\n","1.

However, for more complex programs (like creating the mad libs program), we'll need to write **pseudo code**. Pseudo-code helps us organize our thoughts and outlines what our program is going to do before we write any code. The more concepts/ideas we put into our short-term memory, the more we need to manage.\n","\n","Let's examine these three steps through the lens of finding the length of a list:\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"400\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1X3VZ2ls9raHBQJecjxe-WQhlkcf1StrS\">\n","\n","\n","Notice, for step two, we wrote out the logic for finding the length, without writing it in code. There is no one, correct way of writing pseudo-code. The purpose of pseuod-code is to assist you in writing out your logic so there's no singular correct answer. You can write your pseudocode on a notepad, in a word document, as comments etc. Experiment to see which style you prefer.\n","\n","While writing pseudo-code, it's useful to make drawings of what your program does. Here's what our pseudo-code might look like with drawings:\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"800\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=10M33m0SkBT5pXFxovhU8HWszD0a9lPzd\">\n","\n","We'll be using this pseudocode to write our mad libs program.

The **split()** method takes as an input. Within the parenthesis, we specify the delimiter. The delimiter is what the method will split the string on.
