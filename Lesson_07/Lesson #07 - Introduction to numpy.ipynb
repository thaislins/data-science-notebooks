When we execute Python code, the Python interpreter converts your code into bytecode that your computer can understand, and then runs that [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode). When you write code in Python, you don't have to worry about things like allocating memory on your computer or choosing how certain operations are done by your computer's processor. Python takes care of that for you.\n","\n","<img width=\"500\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WSCD15qS89t5di-x-_WjLHwI6-Tj9EeH\">\n","\n","Python is what we call a **high-level language**. High level languages allow you to write programs faster as the interpreter makes the decisions on how to execute your instructions. In contrast, when you use **low-level** languages like C, you define exactly how memory will be managed and how the processor will execute your instructions. This means that coding in a **low-level language** takes longer, however you have more ability to optimize your code to run faster.\n","\n","| Language Type | Example | Time taken to write program | Control over program performance |\n","|---------------|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n","| High-Level | Python | Low | Low |\n","| Low-Level | C | High | High |\n","\n","When choosing between a high and low-level language, you have to make a trade-off between being able to work and quickly, and having programs that run quickly and efficiently. Luckily, there are two Python libraries that were created to give us the best of both-worlds: **NumPy** and **pandas**. Together, pandas and NumPy provide a powerful toolset for working with data in Python. They allow us to write code quickly without sacrificing performance. But how do they do this? What is it that makes these libraries faster than raw Python? The answer is **vectorization**.\n","\n","\n","**How Vectorization Makes Code Faster**\n","\n","Let's look at an example where we have two columns of data. Each row contains two numbers we wish to add together. Using just Python, we would use a list of lists structure to store our data, and use for loops to iterate over that data. Let's see what this would look like as Python code:\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"800\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=15rYQH5ne_AhjfSzSzsXdV2AdD7LKRsrl\">\n","\n","\n","When this code is run, the Python interpreter will turn our code into bytecode, following the logic of our **for** loop. In each iteration of our loop, the bytecode asks our computer's processor to add the two numbers together and stores the result. The diagram shows the first calculation our computer's processor would make:\n","\n","<img width=\"800\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=10qEvWGmvAHbT1NcqW6D8DjmZzPh08_TZ\">\n","\n","\n","Our computer would take eight processor cycles to process the 8 rows of of our data.\n","\n","Vectorization takes advantage of a processor feature called **Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)** to process data faster. Most modern computer processors support SIMD. SIMD allows a processor to perform the same operation, on multiple data points, in a single processor cycle. Let's look at how a vectorized version of our code above might be processed using a SIMD instruction that allows four data points to be processed at once:\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"800\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1DY8rZ_TtTrOOmG4qWgaEJcVE4vlJAhJc\">\n","\n","The vectorized version of our code will only take two processor cycles to process our eight rows of data - a four times speed-up. Vectorized operations might process as little as two and as many as as hundreds of operations per processor cycle, depending on the capabilities of the processor and the size of each data point.\n","\n","The good news is that you don't have to worry about SIMD and processor cycles, because NumPy and pandas take care of this for you. We'll introduce pandas in more detail later in this course, but first we're going to learn about NumPy so we understand the fundamentals of working with vectorized operations.\n","\n","In the next sections, we'll learn:\n","\n","- How to work with data in using NumPy  objects.\n","- How to explore and clean data.\n","- How to use NumPy to analyze data quickly and efficiently.\n","\n","Let's get started\n","\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"FzdtDuU266BC","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.2 NYC Taxi-Airport Data\n","\n","As we learn NumPy, we'll be analyzing taxi trip data released by the city of New York.

In programming, array is a term that describes a collection of elements. Even if you haven't heard the term before, you have likely encountered arrays: a list object in Python could be described generically as an array. N-dimensional refers to the fact that ndarrays can have one or more dimensions. Let's look at some visualizations of one, two, and three dimensional arrays and their common names:\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Zcmsq84y8NNNNeujYJEO3Nc2gxqkk_m-\">\n","\n","\n","\n","Arrays with more than three dimensions do exist in data science but they're rare. We'll focus on:\n","\n","- One-dimensional ndarrays (1D ndarrays)\n","- Two-dimensional ndarrays (2D ndarrays)\n","\n","Similar to using lists of lists, we use numbers to specify the location of elements of our data that we want to work with. Just like with lists, we call these numbers index values (or collectively, indices).\n","\n","Unlike with Python lists, every value in an ndarray must be of the same types. For the NYC taxi data set this does not matter, as all the values are float values. We'll talk further about this restriction and how to handle it a later mission.\n","\n","Let's take a look at the data in the taxi variable from the previous screen by printing it using [Python's print() function](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#print):\n","\n","```python\n",">>> print(taxi)\n","\n","    [[ 2016.  1.   1.  ..., 11.65  69.99   1. ]\n","     [ 2016.  1.   1.  ...,  8.    54.3    1. ]\n","     [ 2016.  1.   1.  ...,  0.    37.8    2. ]\n","     ..., \n","     [ 2016.  6.  30.  ...,  5.    63.34   1. ]\n","     [ 2016.  6.  30.  ...,  8.95  44.75   1. ]\n","     [ 2016.  6.  30.  ...,  0.    54.84   2. ]]\n","```\n","\n","At first, this looks identical to a list of lists, with two exceptions:\n","\n","- Between the third and fourth column of every row there is an elipsis **(...).**\n","- Between the third and fourth row there is another elipsis.\n","\n","\n","These elipses indicate that there is more data in our NumPy ndarray than can easily be printed. NumPy will summarize any ndarray we print if it contains more than 1000 elements. If we wanted to see the how many rows and columns are in our ndarray, we can use the [ndarray.shape attribute](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.12.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.shape.html#numpy.ndarray.shape). If you like, you can open the console from the bottom right of the interface and run this command to see it for yourself.\n","\n","```python\n",">>> taxi.shape\n","    (89560, 15)\n","```\n","\n","The output of the ndarray.shape attribute gives us a few important pieces of information:\n","\n","- There are two numbers, which tells us that our ndarray is two-dimensional.\n","    - Note: the data type returned is called a [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#tuples). Tuples are very similar to Python lists, but are immutable (can't be modified). Tuples are defined and displayed using parentheses **()** rather than brackets **[]**.\n","- The first number tells us that the first dimension is 89,560 items long, or put another way that there are 89,560 rows in our data set.\n","- The second number tells us that the second dimension is 15 items long, or put another way that there are 15 columns in our data set.\n","\n","If we just want to select a number of rows from an ndarray, we can use slicing, just like we would with a list of lists. Here's how we would print the first five rows:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> print(taxi[:5])\n","\n","    [[ 2016  1  1  5  0  2  4  21    2037  52.   0.8  5.54  11.65  69.99   1  ]\n","     [ 2016  1  1  5  0  2  1  16.29  1520  45.   1.3  0     8    54.3    1  ]\n","     [ 2016  1  1  5  0  2  6  12.7   1462  36.5  1.3  0     0    37.8    2  ]\n","     [ 2016  1  1  5  0  2  6   8.7   1210  26.   1.3  0     5.46  32.76   1  ]\n","     [ 2016  1  1  5  0  2  6   5.56   759  17.5  1.3  0     0    18.8    2  ]]\n","```\n","\n","You'll notice that because we have fewer than 1000 items in our output, NumPy does not summarize the data and we can see all 15 columns (although they're harder to see because each wraps onto a new line).\n","\n","Let's practice making a slice of multiple rows using of our ndarray.\n","\n","**Exercise**\n","\n","<img width=\"100\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E8tR7B9YYUXsU_rddJAyq0FrM0MSelxZ\">\n","\n","Variables we created in previous section!!!! \n","\n","1.
