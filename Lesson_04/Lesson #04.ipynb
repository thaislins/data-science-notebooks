This single file, is generally centered around a specific theme. There are modules that focus on [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) operations, audio files ([audioop](https://docs.python.org/3/library/audioop.html)), image processing ([pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) and many more.\n","\n","Modules improve the readability of our code by abstracting away the implementation while allowing us to understand exactly what the code does.

However, we know exactly what the code does in one line.\n","\n","To load a module, we'll use the **import** statement. For readability, it's usually a good idea to import the modules we'll need in the beginning of our script.\n","\n","\n","When importing a module, we then get access to all the functions and variables within the module.
