In order to do this, we acquired several data sets about [New York City public schools](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/data?cat=education). We manipulated these data sets, and found that we could combine them all using the **DBN** column. All of the data sets are currently stored as **keys** in the **data** dictionary. Each individual data set is a pandas dataframe.\n","\n","In this section, **we'll clean the data a bit more**, then **combine** it. Finally, we'll **compute correlations** and perform some analysis.\n","\n","The first thing we'll need to do in preparation for the merge is condense some of the data sets. In the last section, we noticed that the values in the **DBN** column were unique in the **sat_results** data set. Other data sets like **class_size** had duplicate **DBN** values, however.\n","\n","We'll need to condense these data sets so that each value in the **DBN** column is unique. If not, we'll run into issues when it comes time to combine the data sets.\n","\n","While the main data set we want to analyze, **sat_results**, has unique **DBN** values for every high school in New York City, other data sets aren't as clean. A single row in the **sat_results** data set may match multiple rows in the **class_size** data set, for example. This situation will create problems, because we don't know which of the multiple entries in the **class_size** data set we should combine with the single matching entry in **sat_results**.

This is partly because the data is from different years. Each data set also has inconsistencies in terms of how it was gathered. Human error (and other types of errors) may also play a role. Therefore, we may not find matches for the **DBN** values in **sat_results** in all of the other data sets, and other data sets may have **DBN** values that don't exist in **sat_results**.\n","\n","We'll merge two data sets at a time. For example, we'll merge **sat_results** and **hs_directory**, then merge the result with **ap_2010**, then merge the result of that with **class_size**. We'll continue combining data sets in this way until we've merged all of them. Afterwards, we'll have roughly the same number of rows, but each row will have columns from all of the data sets.\n","\n","The merge strategy we pick will affect the number of rows we end up with.

Depending on the strategy we choose, we may preserve rows at the expense of having more missing column data, or minimize missing data at the expense of having fewer rows. Choosing a merge strategy is an important decision; it's worth thinking about your data carefully, and what trade-offs you're willing to make.\n","\n","Because this project is concerned with determing demographic factors that correlate with SAT score, we'll want to preserve as many rows as possible from **sat_results** while minimizing null values.\n","\n","This means that we may need to use different merge strategies with different data sets. Some of the data sets have a lot of missing **DBN** values. This makes a **left** join more appropriate, because we don't want to lose too many rows when we merge. If we did an **inner** join, we would lose the data for many high schools.\n","\n","Some data sets have **DBN** values that are almost identical to those in **sat_results**. Those data sets also have information we need to keep. Most of our analysis would be impossible if a significant number of rows was missing from **demographics**, for example.

This is because pandas couldn't find the **DBN** values that existed in **sat_results** in the other data sets. While this is worth investigating, we're currently looking for high-level correlations, so we don't need to dive into which **DBNs** are missing.\n","\n","You may also have noticed that we now have many columns with null (**NaN**) values. This is because we chose to do **left** joins, where some columns may not have had data. The data set also had some missing values to begin with. If we hadn't performed a **left** join, all of the rows with missing data would have been lost in the merge process, which wouldn't have left us with many high schools in our data set.\n","\n","There are several ways to handle missing data, and we'll cover them in more detail later on.

We replace the missing values with the means of their respective columns, which allows us to proceed with analyses that can't handle missing values (like correlations).\n","\n","We can fill in missing data in pandas using the [pandas.DataFrame.fillna()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.fillna.html) method. This method will replace any missing values in a dataframe with the values we specify. We can compute the mean of every column using the [pandas.DataFrame.mean()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.mean.html) method. If we pass the results of the **df.mean()** method into the **df.fillna()** method, pandas will fill in the missing values in each column with the mean of that column.\n","\n","Here's an example of how we would accomplish this:\n","\n","```python\n","means = df.mean()\n","df = df.fillna(means)\n","```\n","\n","Note that if a column consists entirely of null or **NaN** values, pandas won't be able to fill in the missing values when we use the **df.fillna()** method along with the **df.mean()** method, because there won't be a mean.\n","\n","We should fill any **NaN** or null values that remain after the initial replacement with the value 0.
